		<p>Today, 15 September 2014, WikiLeaks releases previously unseen copies of weaponised German surveillance malware used by intelligence agencies around the world to spy on journalists, political dissidents and others.</p>
		<p>FinFisher (formerly part of the UK based Gamma Group International until late 2013) is a German company that produces and sells computer intrusion systems, software exploits and remote monitoring systems that are capable of intercepting communications and data from OS X, Windows and Linux computers as well as Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Symbian and Windows Mobile devices. FinFisher first came to public attention in December 2011 when WikiLeaks published documents detailing their products and business in the first <a href="https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles">SpyFiles</a> release.</p>
						<p>Since the first SpyFiles release, researchers published <a href="https://citizenlab.org/storage/finfisher/final/fortheireyesonly.pdf">reports</a> that identified the presence of FinFisher products in countries around the world and documented its use against journalists, activists and political dissidents.</p>
						<p>Julian Assange, WikiLeaks Editor in Chief said: "FinFisher continues to operate brazenly from Germany selling weaponised surveillance malware to some of the most abusive regimes in the world. The Merkel government pretends to be concerned about privacy, but its actions speak otherwise. Why does the Merkel government continue to protect FinFisher? This full data release will help the technical community build tools to protect people from FinFisher including by tracking down its command and control centers."</p>
						<p><b>FinFisher Relay</b> and <b>FinSpy Proxy</b> are the components of the FinFisher suite responsible for collecting the data acquired from the infected victims and delivering it to their controllers. It is commonly deployed by FinFisher's customers in strategic points around the world to route the collected data through an anonymizing chain, in order to disguise the identity of its operators and the real location of the final storage, which is instead operated by the <b>FinSpy Master</b>.</p><table class="table table-bordered">

		</tbody></table><p>WikiLeaks is also publishing previously unreleased copies of the <b>FinFisher FinSpy PC</b> spyware for Windows. This software is designed to be covertly installed on a Windows computer and silently intercept files and communications, such as Skype calls, emails, video and audio through the webcam and microphone (you can find more details on FinSpy in the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/docs/gamma/289_remote-monitoring-and-infection-solutions-finspy.html">first SpyFiles release</a>). In order to prevent any accidental execution and infection, the following files have been renamed and compressed in password protected archives (the password is "infected"). They are weaponised malware, so handle carefully.</p><table class="table table-bordered">

		</tbody></table><p>In order to challenge the secrecy and the lack of accountability of the surveillance industry, analyzing the internals of this software could allow security and privacy researchers to develop new fingerprints and detection techniques, identify more countries currently using the FinFisher spyware and uncover human rights abuses.</p><p>In addition, in this fourth iteration of the SpyFiles collection, WikiLeaks publishes the newly indexed material the same as the <a href="https://twitter.com/GammaGroupPR">recent FinFisher breach</a> (for which you can find the torrent file <a href="https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles4/finfisher.torrent">here</a>), including new brochures and a database of the customer support website, that provide updated details on their productline and a unique insight into the company's customer-base.</p>
		<p>In order to make the data more easily accessible and consumable, all the new brochures, videos and manuals <a href="https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles4/documents.html">are now available</a> organized under the related FinFisher product name. The <a href="https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles4/database.html">database</a> is represented in full, from which WikiLeaks compiled a list of customers, their eventual attribution, all the associated support tickets and acquired licenses, along with the estimated costs calculated from FinFisher's price list.</p>
		<p><b>WikiLeaks conservatively estimates FinFisher's revenue from these sales to amount to around â‚¬50,000,000</b>. Within the full list of <a href="https://wikileaks.org/spyfiles4/customers.html">customers</a>, it's worth noticing that among the largest is <a href="https://www.freedomonlinecoalition.com/news/mongolia-the-next-freedom-online-coalition-chair/">Mongolia, which has been recently selected as new Chair of the Freedom Online Coalition</a>.</p>
		<p>Together with the previous releases, the SpyFiles collection represents a unique and central resource where to find extensive and exclusive documentation about the global surveillance industry, also indexed and searchable through the <a href="http://search.wikileaks.org/advanced?q=FinFisher&amp;exclude_words=&amp;words_title_only=&amp;words_content_only=&amp;publication_type[]=9&amp;sort=0">WikiLeaks Search</a>.</p>
